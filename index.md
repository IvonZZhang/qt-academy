The Qt Academy offers you all about how to play with one of the most fanscinating
C++ framework - Qt.

The inspiration and all the layout/style of this website is from [./missing-semester](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/), a course organised by MIT about all the trivial skills that are difficult to teach systematically in higher educations but are super useful. They're awesome.
