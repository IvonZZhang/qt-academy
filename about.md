As a C++ programmer, Qt is without doubt one of the best things
to master. Though Qt is well documented, I felt difficult to 
find my way out as a beginner through complicated documentations
and quickly get something out of it. I hoped that there could be
some explanations helping beginners like me to get on track quickly
even with inaccurate or incomplete explanations on some topics, 
so that I become able to learn from official documentations on my
own.
