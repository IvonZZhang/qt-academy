Qt is a cross-platform application and UI framework. It is primarily designed to make "Creating cross-platform GUI applications with C++" much easier, and it nailed it, but over the years it grows into a really big and powerful collection including QML (a new and better way to make UI with a description), QtPy (Python support) and so many other cool stuff.

We will cover only a small but core part of Qt, basically what you might want to know if you use C++ and you want to make your life much easier.
